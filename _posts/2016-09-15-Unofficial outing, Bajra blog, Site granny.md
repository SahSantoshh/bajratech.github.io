Hello beautiful people, it is the end of the week here at Bajra and this is ** drum roll ** the first Bajra`s Bajra Weekly.

First and foremost I am very excited to let you guys know that Bajra Weekly is official. I want to thank our CEO Nishant daii for supporting it and Ankur, Suman, Degendra and Loomila for contributing a lot to the platform. I hope that this platform will provide a great opportunity to develop a habit of blogging for BajraBeings.


Fellow Bajra co-workers and I took an unofficial outing to tranquil Markhu, Kulekhani for the weekend. We were accompanied by leeches on the route and they kept us motivated to walk quickly. Despite our attempt to keep them at bay they somehow managed to get inside our shoe and suck some blood out. I am very proud of my co-workers because they got out of their comfort zones, fought their way through forest trails filled with blood thirsty vampires and for traveling the most dangerous road (road to Hetauda). And what is so sexy about vampires??

Finally Bajra relased its own product `Site Granny`, which monitors your website/web apps, after a year. Though the release happened a week before this I felt like it was such an important event and it should not go unnoticed. We celebrated the release by cutting cakes and smearing it on the developer`s face (they deserved it).

At last, have a great weekend to all and you all are awesome. :D :D
