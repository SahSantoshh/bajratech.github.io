<p align="justify">Where does the project ideas come from? The answer is they come from some of the problems, opportunities and directives. The short definition of problem, opportunity and directive defined for an organization is given below :</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Problem: An undesirable situation that prevents the organization from fully achieving its goals or objectives</p>
<p align="justify">Opportunity: A chance to improve the organization even in the absence of the identified problems</p>
<p align="justify">Directives: A new requirement that is imposed by the management, government and/or external influences</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">So while working on the projects, various problems arise that cannot be predicted. But if we follow some framework, it becomes easier to solve the problems. One of the frameworks developed by the James Wetherbe is known as PIECES, where each of the letters represent a category. We have six categories in this framework which are enlisted below:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<div align="justify">P : the need to correct or improve the ‘Performance’</div></li>
 	<li>
<div align="justify">I : the need to correct or improve the ‘Information (and data)’</div></li>
 	<li>
<div align="justify">E : the need to correct or improve the ‘economics, control costs or profits’</div></li>
 	<li>
<div align="justify">C : the need to correct or improve ‘control or security’</div></li>
 	<li>
<div align="justify">E : the need to correct or improve ‘efficiency of people and process’</div></li>
 	<li>
<div align="justify">S : the need to correct or improve ‘service to customers, suppliers, partners, employees and so on’</div></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">The categories mentioned above may overlap. Some problems arise in such a way that their solution may fall on one or all of the categories. So The problem must be identified and solved as per requirement.</p>
