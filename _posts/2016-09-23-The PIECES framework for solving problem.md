<p align="justify">Where does the project ideas comes from? The answer is It comes from some of the problems, opportunities and directives. A short definition of problem, opportunity and directive is given below which is defined for organization</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Problem: An undesirable situation that prevents the organization from fully achieving its goals or objectives</p>
<p align="justify">Opportunity: A chance to improve the organization even in the absence of the identified problems</p>
<p align="justify">Directives: A new requirement that is imposed by the management, government and or external influence</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">So while working on the projects various problems arises. It cannot be predicted. But if we follow some framework it becomes easier to solve the problem. One of the framework developed by the James Wetherbe is known as PIECES, where each of the letter represents a category. We have six categories in this framework which are enlisted below:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<div align="justify">P the need to correct or improve the ‘Performance’</div></li>
 	<li>
<div align="justify">I the need to correct or improve the ‘Information (and data)’</div></li>
 	<li>
<div align="justify">E the need to correct or improve the ‘economics, control costs or profits’</div></li>
 	<li>
<div align="justify">C the need to correct or improve ‘control or security’</div></li>
 	<li>
<div align="justify">E the need to correct or improve ‘efficiency of people and process’</div></li>
 	<li>
<div align="justify">S the need to correct or improve ‘service to customers, suppliers, partners, employees and so on’</div></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">The categories as shown above may overlap. Some problems are in such a way that their  solution may fall on one or all of the categories. So The problem must be identified and solved as per requirement.</p>
