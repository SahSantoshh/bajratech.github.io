 It had just been few days that we were back to our work-spaces after `Dashain` and it took no time for `Tihar - The festival of lights` to find us again. All of us were excited about Tihar holidays, and our excitement doubled when our HR manager `Sandesh dai` notified us that we were having a **pizza party** as Tihar celebration.

 A day before the holidays, after 5 pm, we wrapped our things up and got into the celebration mood. We were quite surprised to see large sized pizzas when we opened the boxes. Those pizzas filled our tummies to the fullest!  :D Everybody seemed to enjoy their pizza slices and gave their remarks about the amazing toppings and flavors. My mouth still waters when I picture those big yummy pizza slices. Everybody loved their pieces of pizzas. As the fun continued, our friends started playing cards, `The Flash`, which boosted our festive spirits. The environment was filled with laughter and amusement as everyone was cracking jokes and making fun of each other (its actually a daily routine here at **Bajra**). Greetings that said “Happy Tihar!” could be heard all over. 

> P.S. I forgot to mention that Sajan won everybody else's money and hence couldn't fit it all inside his wallet.

After a week long holidays and hangover of **Tihar**, we came back to office with fresh minds, enthusiasm and energy. Despite the transportation inconvenience all of us faced due to the Indian Presidential visit, we somehow managed to reach office. Happy to see each other after a week, we greeted each other with 
>“Tihar kasto vayo ta? “ 
and obviously shared each others’ experiences. It looked quite odd seeing only half of us present in the office since some of our fellow `BajraBeings` were on long leave preparing for their GRE examinations and some were still in their hometowns waiting for another big festival `Chhath`.

The next day, our friend `Sajan - the expressionist` informed us all that a former employee of Bajra - `Subash dai` had invited us for a get-together. As he was leaving the country, all of us were there to bid him farewell. After office hours, we made our way to Bijulibazar where we met him and had a wonderful time together. **Best wishes Subash Dai! We will miss you! And thanks for your treat !**

The next day after Chhath - Monday,  was a chilled morning. I realized how Kathmandu was getting colder day by day. Our HR, `Sandesh dai`, was back from his adventurous trip to Mustang. Our friend `Pushpa` was also back from her hometown. We got lucky as they  brought us some “Koseli”. We got to taste yummy “syau ko sukuti” from Mustang and Tihar special Nepali Rotis “Anarsa” brought by Pushpa.

After tons of `kyaukyau` to `Sandesh dai`, the most awaited “office hoodies” with a printed logo and a slogan “GEEK INSIDE!” arrived. All of us were trying them to find the good match of size. All of sudden, the entire office looked maroon as everyone of us were wearing them right away. We were just happy wearing those hoodies, then the next day we got our Office Identity cards! We all were extremely proud reading our names on the cards and being an employee of **Bajra**.

**Thank you `Bajra Technologies` for these really supercool stuffs !**

Its almost the end of the week and our other friends are also back to office after celebrating Chhath. `Santosh Sah` brought the Chhath special item '"Thekuwa” for all of us. The office is lively again, pulling up their sleeves and getting back to work. 
 
And therefore, like every other days, past few days at Bajra went pretty amusing ! :) GoodDay everyone! Happy Weekend!
