From the childhood days, I have been recognized as a passionate learner in my friend’s circle. I am always enticed by the idea of potraying new innovations and creativity in everything I do. Art and writing poems used to be my hobby before I understood the beauty of programming. I believe today’s era is full of two groups of people. One- who get fascinated by the growth of technological innovations and Next- who actually thrive to make that happen. Well, I feel really glad to be the part of second group. Hello Everyone, this is me Samira Sharma, a dreamer and an obsessed learner. 
 
On the first day, I remember walking into Bajra, a bit nervous but with lots of hopes and expectations. And all these months, I have memories of leaving office with a smile on face, happy that I get something new to learn everyday. The best part of Bajra is the productive work environment. We work in a team and put our best to give a required outcome.  No project gets completed without facing tons of issues but I find my seniors on every step of the way, providing proper guidance  and correcting our mistakes. This gives me the motivation to work harder and perform even better. Working on a project here is an gratifying experience and I love every part  of it. I have felt a big personal growth in these few months.

Being in Bajra is like getting happiness in a package.  Within few weeks of joining, I got chance to  be a part of Bandipur trip. Well, that trip not only helped me to get along with everyone so easily but also gave me the opportunity of experiencing cave rappeling which was one of the wish from my wishlist.  Apart from coding, there are lots of other leisure activities we do jointly. Whether it be indoor mobile games, carromboard or friday fun activity, we always have a great time together. Moreover, the conversation we do during the lunch time is the next most interesting part. Let’s not get the delusions that we discuss only about the new releases of the technical fields, we find completely new topics to talk about everyday- sometimes spiritual, sometimes about the outing sites and sometimes about the personal experiences. Should I forget to mention the lunch and snacks ?  No, definitely not. I must say we are served with the most hygienic and appetizing food.

I have learned lots of beneficial things from my colleagues and seniors. Useful advices I get from them has proven to be beyond helpful . Altogether, I feel really contented to be a part of Bajra Team and believe  that there is always a lot to look forward to.
