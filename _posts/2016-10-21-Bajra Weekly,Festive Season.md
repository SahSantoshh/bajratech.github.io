> "Dashain pachhi hamro lagi ghar bata k k lyaune ta?"

Well,  the festive season is on and this was our major discussion on the last day at our office before Dashain Holidays. Some of our fellow **BajraBeings** had planned to visit their hometowns to celebrate Dashain and **we** were all discussing about what they'd bring for us from their home. We were all so excited about **Dashain** ( long holidays actually :P ) that the excitement filled our office with non-stop giggles, laughter and gossips, which I'm sure  could be heard even ten meters away.

> "Sandesh, timro game khelaune paalo kaile ho khoi?"

If someone ever asked this question to **Sandesh dai** about his turn to organize **Friday Fun Activity**, he'd simply reply

> "Khoi kaile kaile aba....pachhhiiii !!! Last ma ho ni mero paalo ta !! "

But to everyrone's astonishment, **Sandesh dai** voluntarily agreed to plan **Dashain Party** and **Dashain Game**. Of course, I assisted him in planning games and buying the gifts though :). We decided to plan **Obstacle Race**, where there would be two teams and each team member would have to pass through a **Hula hoop** and then get inside a sack that reached up to their waist and hop to the finishing line, and the team that completes the race first would be the winning team. We bought gifts (face wash and face soaps) that could be very useful during festivals like Dashain where one needs to put a lot of tika.

We enjoyed the **Dashain  Party** with beer, our regular Guava juice, chhoyela and momo with hot chilly sauce. The game went pretty well and I'm quite sure everyone present there remembers **Chudamani Dai** and **Santosh Sah**'s long jumps during the sack race.

**Sushant - the garibb** is no longer "garibb" as he won everybody else's money who played cards on that day. This paragraph actually intends to make **Ankur Dai**, **Suman Dai**, **Milan Dai**,  **Degendra Dai** and **Prabhat Dai** jealous as they were not present while we enjoyed the treat and games.

Bajra has become a family now and I can't deny that I immensely missed it during the holidays. I could not wait to get back to everybody and talk about how our Dashain went. Finally, after 10 long days, we are all happy to be back. Our dearest **Gaurub Dai** has returned with a `Namaskar sabailai` and the office is lively again.



There is nothing new that has happened after Dashain break except for **Sushant- the Garibb**'s new haircut , **Suman Dai**'s GoPro, my NUC and obviously the wait for **Tihar Holidays**.

Ummmm...I guess I forgot to mention something worth mentioning!! **Nishant Dai** has bought a new car and he has treated us all with **Chocolate Ice cream** today. ""Congratulations and Thank you Dai!!** 

Lastly, the temperature has started to drop down so **Stay Warm** everyone!!


Adios!!
