Welcome back to Bajra Weekly!
===================
Greetings! 
Well, there are a lot of things going on in the office after a long festive season. Everyone here is undoubtedly `supercharged` to get back to work with `good spirits`. Back with so much energy and power, I see everyone digging into codes and research. Nevertheless, we still have the same energy to have fun. 

Last week, we celebrated Suresh's birthday and I can't deny that my mouth watered after seeing two delicious cakes on the table. Everyone present there felt like "man, it feels good to cut 2 cakes on a birthday". It was quite shocking when Loomila, who is usually calm, tried to put some cake on Suresh's face and he was like "पख तिम्रो birthday मा".  Though Loomila could complete the `cake-mission` to some level only, `Puspanjali` succeeded this mission completely. Too bad that we dont have any good pictures of Suresh with cake all over his face.

After coming back from weekend, we had a little change in our gaming venue during the lunch break. As it is chilling weather now, "**Mini Militia**" team these days have shifted their gaming hub outside the office warming themselves physically as well as in the game. Sajan says

Apart from that, working here has always been a wonderful experience. We are having changes in our website along with a new mobile app. That's a good news, isn't it? Whenever we get bored, we start a discussion over chat and that conversation goes punching everyone. We have futsal every Friday.  After weeks of rest to recover futsal injury, our favorite `Sandesh bro` went back to play futsal. Yeaah!!! Thankfully nobody was injured, else there would have been a better content for this blog. :D

This is what Bajra family is about. We have fun and work at the same time. We share happiness and knowledge whenever we want and everyone is ready to listen to it. We are really blessed to be a part of it.

Weather these days are chilling. Stay warm and see you folks next week again.
