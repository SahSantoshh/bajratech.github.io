> It always seems impossible until it is done

Ever since I joined Bajra, I have been wanting to write a blog for Bajra. To be honest, I have been blogging, but it was mostly focused on my travel stuff and less on tech stuffs. Now that Bajra Weekly is official, I can hone my skills on the tech stack too. In this tech era, having a presence in the internet is a must, that is why we connect to social media doing our micro blogging there. Via Bajra Weekly we want to be sharing something that is going to be useful to everyone in and outside of Bajra Tech so this is why we are blogging now. But that sounds like an incomplete answer, so here are some reason why we are blogging now-

* Sharing knowledge on different tech stack

	Bajra has more than one team working on different projects. Those different projects are built on different tech stack. I keep myself up to date with the tech stack I am working on via mailing lists and if I find something really awesome, I would also want others to know about it but the programmers working on different stack would not know about it. To bridge that gap, this weekly can help them a lot as well.

* Sharing solutions to the problems
	
	There can be more than a way to solve an issue, but only a way that can solve it better. The thing is that, if it happened to you, it could happen to anyone or it has already happened to someone. You could write a way to solve that problem and hopefully that anyone would come across the post and find it useful.

* Sharing things beyond the tech stuffs

	Not everyone at Bajra codes. We have Operation Manager and financial officer. They also need to blog too, they will also have something cool to share too. I do not know about you, but I am a nerd with diverse interests. As much as you think coding is a tough job, Operation, Management and financial management are also difficult as well. So let us read about how to manage a company or how to manage finances in a company too. Who knows? You may end up starting your own business some day.

* Letting the World know what Bajra is up to
	
	> Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life. 

	Working for Bajra, from my personal experience, has been so much fun. It is nearly going to be a year now that I have joined Bajra but boy does it feel like I just joined yesterday?. Apart from work, BajraBeings(that`s what we call ourselves) spends quality time together. We spend most of our quality time mobile gaming but you would argue how is that possible? I would say, you have no idea. Mobile gaming has brought the co workers together, created a strong bond and mostly made us feel like family.

Finally, let me end this blog with a sweet picture of Bajra Family. We are not all in it but I am putting it here to show you all how good looking we are. I am the one wearing the ACDC tanktop.
