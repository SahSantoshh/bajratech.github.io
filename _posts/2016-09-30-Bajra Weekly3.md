Another Friday is here, a little bit special because it’s the last Friday of September and the end of another good week here at `Bajra`. 
It has been a really exciting week for all of us. 

Let's start with the Friday fun activity. `Ayush Bati` and `Santosh Sah` organized a  game `Ping-Pong ball throw-catch`. It was exciting and fun and we all enjoyed it a lot. The game was intended for refreshment and to build communication among members.

We also celebrated `Ashok (The Great) dai`'s birthday this week. 
Warm birthday wishes to our dearest `Ashok dai!` You are a year older now but I think turning one year old is AWESOME! :D

Our `IoT` team were doing a research on different IoT Platforms `(Kaa IoT, AWS IoT, Azure IoT)` and I have thoroughly enjoyed learning about their power and potentials.
It is indeed an interesting topic to go through.  You guys should  definitely check it out during your spare time. It's been told that by 2020, 20 billion devices will be connected to the IoT. 

That would be all for this week… Happy Weekends people!
