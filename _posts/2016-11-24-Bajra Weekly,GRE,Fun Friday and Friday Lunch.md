Bonjour de belles personnes, how u doing?

> Friday. My second favourite F word after food.

This week, `Bajra` was buzzing with the talk of shifting Bajra's office to a new location.Some were ecstatic and some were clutched because of the commute time. I was neutral because I welcome change, however, `Loomila` seemed to be a bit concerned. Luckily, `Bajra` will be shifting to `Gyaneshwor` and I want to thank, not the god, but `Bajra` for that.

After the holidays of **Tihar**, some of the `BajraBeings` were on leave to prepare for their GRE.Their absence was like an apple pie without an apple but they are finally back again. `Ankur` daii was complaining about his score in GRE but I just want to tell him that he has scored amazing marks. Brother, I can not even pass an exam.

Yesterday, `Samira` burnt herself. It is not her fault, she just wanted to bath with hot boiling water.I hope she will be fine real soon.

Last week's friday, `Rabin` and `Pravin` organized team building activity. We played tug of war (tug of woo as per `Loomila`). Let me tell you, the game was very unfair. That is all I have to say about it.

Today we went out for our lunch and it was very exciting.

Last but not the least, the `IOT Team` (`Me`, `Sajan` daii and `Dhurba`) will be working on another portal which I do not want to disclose here. Please keep followinig our weekly to know more about the project.

So much have happened at Bajra this week. Now it is time for the `BajraBeings` to get their mind off the work and enjoy the weekends. Have a great day fellas.

> Yay, it is weekend. Oh wait, I am a programmer
